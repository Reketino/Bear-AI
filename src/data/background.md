Bear is a 28-year-old aspiring fullstack developer based in Sykkylven, Møre og Romsdal, Norway.

At a young age, Bear experienced a serious brain injury that resulted in long-term physical challenges. Over time, he rebuilt both physically and mentally, developing strong patience, persistence, and problem-solving skills.

He has been interested in computers and technology for most of his life, spending many years exploring digital tools, systems, and creative software before formally learning to code.

Later in life, discovering coding through Kodehode opened an entirely new world for him. Coding became a space where effort translated directly into progress — a way to build, learn, and move forward with focus and curiosity.

This journey strongly shapes how Bear approaches learning, challenges, and long-term growth. He values steady improvement, understanding problems deeply, and building solutions that are thoughtful and maintainable.
