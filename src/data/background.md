Bear experienced a serious brain injury at a young age, which led to long-term physical challenges.

Over time, he rebuilt both physically and mentally, developing strong patience, persistence, and problem-solving skills.

Later in life, discovering coding through Kodehode opened an entirely new world for him.
Coding became a place where effort translated directly into progress — a way to build, learn, and move forward with focus and curiosity.

This journey strongly shapes how Bear approaches learning, challenges, and long-term growth.
